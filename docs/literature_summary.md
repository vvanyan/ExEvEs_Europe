# Literature summary and reflection on methods
Extreme Evaporation Events (ExEvEs) are defined as temporally coherent periods of unusually high terrestrial evaporation that emerge from the intrinsic persistence of the evaporation process. Using daily evaporation from GLEAM at 0.25° resolution (1981–2022), (Markonis et al.,2025) first removed seasonality by standardizing evaporation (and co-analyzed radiation) to z-scores within five-day (pentad) windows at each grid cell. On this deseasonalized series, they demonstrated statistically that daily evaporation retains positive autocorrelation for roughly ten days and exhibits a mean Hurst coefficient of about 0.85, consistent with long-term persistence and temporal clustering. This persistence justifies treating exceedances not as isolated spikes but as events. ExEvEs are then identified as consecutive days with standardized evaporation above the 0.80 quantile that include at least one day above the 0.95 quantile, a working definition that is reproducible and physically interpretable while acknowledging that threshold choice inevitably carries some subjectivity (Markonis et al., 2025).

The methodology was applied over Czechia (12–19° E, 48.5–51° N), a temperate region chosen to limit heterogeneity and clarify physical interpretation. Two seasonal behaviors emerged. During summer, event onset coincided with elevated shortwave and longwave radiation and low precipitation, conditions that raise available energy and atmospheric evaporative demand. As events matured, shortwave radiation tended to decline while precipitation increased, consistent with cloud development that both moderates solar input and replenishes surface moisture; at the same time, energy partitioning shifted toward latent heat, with sensible heat becoming weak or negative at termination as evaporation cooled the surface. During winter, events occurred under relatively low shortwave radiation but enhanced longwave radiation and high precipitation, indicating moisture-driven extremes when solar heating is seasonally limited. To evaluate hydrologic impacts, the study contrasted changes in daily (P-E) (a proxy for land wetness) and ((P+E)/2) (a metric of land–atmosphere water-exchange intensity) within and outside ExEvEs across two recent subperiods. Regionally, conditions shifted toward overall drying with faster exchange; yet within ExEvEs most grid cells became wetter and showed accelerated exchange, whereas outside ExEvEs there was widespread decelerated drying. The reported rise in ExEvE frequency tripled the share of annual evaporation occurring during these events to roughly one-fifth, while total precipitation increased only modestly overall but approximately doubled during ExEvEs between the two periods considered (Markonis et al., 2025). These findings indicate that short, clustered episodes of intense evaporation increasingly concentrate water and energy transfers and thereby contribute to water-cycle intensification despite a background tendency toward drying.

The *evapoRe* framework provides the computational environment necessary to reproduce and extend these analyses in a transparent and standardized way (Vargas Godoy & Markonis, 2023). *evapoRe* harmonizes more than twenty evapotranspiration (ET) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) products onto a common 0.25° grid and daily or monthly time step, offers PET calculations based on classical methods (including Penman–Monteith and Priestley–Taylor), and implements standardized anomalies and event-detection procedures that align with the ExEvE formulation. In this setup, GLEAM serves as the primary daily ET product for event detection; CAMELE, an ensemble ET dataset constructed from multiple sources with weights informed by performance against flux-tower observations, provides a bias-reduced monthly reference for validation; and reanalyses such as ERA5 (and, where relevant, MERRA-2) supply the meteorological and energy-flux drivers—shortwave and longwave radiation, temperature, humidity, wind, and surface fluxes—required to diagnose whether events are energy- or moisture-limited. Indices such as the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI = ET/PET) and the standardized ET-deficit index (SEDI) further contextualize vegetation stress and departures from atmospheric demand (Vargas Godoy & Markonis, 2023). Together, the ExEvE conceptual framework and the *evapoRe* toolchain enable consistent detection, validation, and physical interpretation of evaporation extremes. The *evapoRe* package operationalizes the ExEvE framework by implementing functions such as detect_exeve() for quantile-based event identification, calc_esi() and calc_sedi() for assessing evaporative stress, and visualization tools (plot_exeve(), plot_ts(), and plot_map()) for spatiotemporal analysis. These functions replicate the same thresholding and compositing logic used in (Markonis et al. 2025), enabling reproducible detection, validation, and interpretation of extreme evaporation events across multiple datasets.


# Reflection on methods
 A reproducible ExEvE analysis proceeds in three stages that directly follow the approach of (Markonis et al. 2025) and the capabilities described in (Vargas Godoy & Markonis, 2023). First, daily GLEAM evaporation is harmonized to a 0.25° grid and standardized to z-scores within pentads at each grid cell to remove seasonality and place values on a comparable scale. Second, extreme periods are detected by applying the quantile thresholds used by (Markonis et al. 2025): events are defined as consecutive days above the 0.80 quantile of standardized evaporation with at least one day above the 0.95 quantile, and consecutive exceedances are grouped to yield event start and end dates, duration, peak intensity, and cumulative anomaly. Sensitivity checks with alternative but analogous thresholds may be used to confirm robustness without altering conclusions about clustering or physical structure. Third, the physical context is established by compositing driver variables before, during, and after detected events. ERA5 provides downward shortwave and longwave radiation, precipitation, near-surface temperature and humidity, wind, and surface fluxes that allow diagnosis of energy partitioning (latent vs. sensible) and moisture supply; where aerosol-radiation interactions are a concern, MERRA-2 can supplement the radiation analysis. For hydrologic impacts, daily (P-E) and ((P+E)/2) are contrasted within and outside events across periods to separate changes associated with the events from background trends. Within *evapoRe*, these steps are implemented with standardized data-processing and event-detection utilities, PET and index calculations for ESI and SEDI, and mapping/time-series visualization functions that mirror the workflow in the cited studies (Vargas Godoy & Markonis, 2023); (Markonis et al., 2025).
